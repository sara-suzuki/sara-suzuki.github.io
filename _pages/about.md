Hello there! Thank you for visiting my personal website. I am an applied and developmental scholar studying youth civic engagement.

I currently work as a Senior Researcher at [CIRCLE](https://circle.tufts.edu/), a non-partisan research center that is part of the Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University.

Feel free to reach out to me at sara[dot]suzuki[at]tufts[dot]edu.
